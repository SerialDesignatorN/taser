# Taser
Taserize any process with just a CLI interface. Take a break from typing commands to kill a process.
# Info
This was meant to be a just-for-fun project. I made Taser in Shell from scratch to kill process with ease
without having to type ```kill <PROCESSID>``` or ```killall <PROCESSNAME>```. Just follow the CLI with just only a argument including process ID or name. 
Everything will be done in the shell script so you only need to type the process ID or name without to type the command.
# How to run
I only have instructions for Linux or Unix or DOS. Sorry, Windows users.
### To start
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/zeankundev/taser
```
2. Change to the cloned folder
```
cd taser
```
3. Run it and have fun!
```
bash taser.sh
```
Make sure you run the main ```taser.sh``` shell script. Try executing the shell script in the cmd folder. :)
